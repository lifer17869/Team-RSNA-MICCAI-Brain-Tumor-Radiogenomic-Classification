# problem statement
Brain tumors can be seen as a deadly disease. Expected life on the patients with this disease is varies between 5 to 10 years. Based on published information on Both the National Brain Tumor Foundation (NBTF) and the American Brain Tumor Associations (ABTA) this growth makes brain tumor the primary reason for death in all age groups with tumor issues.
Recent development in Machin learning and deep learning area makes it easier to detect tumors With useful information about different imaginary techniques like MRI, PET Ct scan and etc, there are a lot of resource as input image and video for detecting the tumors. One the most famous of them is BRATS.
about development of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).In early years most of the CNNs were shallow and number of layers were low. These number of layers has been increased throw years and more sophisticated algorithms has been proposed. In recent years most of the Tumor segmentation task have been by U net and different version of Capsule Net. And please also mention that the accuracy of models has been increased from 88% to 96 from 2018 to 2021. Most of the work had used MRI and CT data 
# Production Mission
For developing such a model as our main mission we need to have proper dataset with good model for archiving this mission our work will be subcategorize as these steps:  
1.	Use AI for tumors detection.
2.	Using RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification.
3.	Develop a Convolutional Neural Network for working on the tumor's classification.
4.	Testing different structure for Brain Tumor classification.
5.	Evaluating Best proposed model.
6.	Choosing best model for classification.
