# Train the Data by Using Two different Models
We studied two types of model methods of deep learning.   
One is Resnet, a kind of traditional deep learing method. Another one is EfficientNet, a currently created method that could improve the training efficiency as well as prediction performance.  
In this step, we will introduce some detail of both models and train our dataset in order to get the models for the next step.

More detail introduction are showed in the sprint3 presentation slides. Also, our code files are uploaded in each file.
